# code-challenges
This repository stores the implementation of three computer vision programming challenges.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
This code was implemented using __Python 3__ (3.7.0) and __OpenCV__ (3.4.3).

### Challenge 1
Real time lane detection for the video provided. The video is divided in 699 frames and processed through OpenCV. Image processing techniques and filters used: 
* Canny edge detection
* Gaussian blur
* Hough lines

### Challenge 2
Real time moving person identification for the video provided. The video is divided in 699 frames and processed through OpenCV. Image processing techniques and filters used: 
* MOG2 Background Subtractor 
* Median blur
* Erosion and dilation
* Opening and closing
* Contour detection
